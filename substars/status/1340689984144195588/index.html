  	      The melodramatic McMansion-esque architecture and too-loud music made watching the adjacent Lake Street bustle like a really weird Koyaanisqatsi. I never sat facing the parking lot, or the police station.

  	      There always seemed to be about two other occupied tables there, someone lingering with just french fries or a family with kids' meals. People always talked about that Arby's like it was super trashy but it felt peaceful and dignified to me. It was well-run and predictable.

  	      I worked at an Arby's in the 90s, where my break time, sitting at a corner table  with some DIY concoction on an onion bun  was probably the least stressful time I had between difficult home and school life and...working at Arby's.

  	      Anyway, would have been comforting to watch Lake Street rebuild from one of those seats while enjoying my nth Coke Zero refill. I'm sure new local spots will provide views that show the strength or our community. But they won't have 3 Pepper Sauce, so I will grieve a little bit.
