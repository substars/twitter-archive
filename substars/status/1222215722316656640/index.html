  	      Eng Team was slated to move into a new office. Saw in the blueprint that their open workspace was right next to a large kitchen, separated by two large, open entryways. Team speculated it might get noisy, asked for doors. Leadership said sure. (2/7)

  	      First day in the new office, team came in and saw that there were no doors. Endured cupcake parties for new hires, boisterous lunches, intimate details of coworkers' weekends. Didn't want to ask people to be quiet because ppl were using the space (mostly) as intended. (3/7)

  	      After a few weeks, a team member asked leadership about that door. They said no, build-out was already over budget. Team sulked, complained, gave up and went for a walk during kitchen loudness, etc. (4/7)

  	      About two years later, team member made an offhand comment about the constant noise that was overheard by the CEO. "It's that distracting? We can put in doors. Why didn't you say something sooner?" (5/7)

  	      Doors went in a few months later, helped a lot. CEO advised team to keep asking for what they needed next time. Ridiculous, the team thought, the need for this was evident from the beginning. (6/7)

  	      Sometimes identifying the cost doesn't get you anywhere. Don't think of asks in terms of idempotency, find new ways to ask the same question and quantify the impact if you want the best shot at buy-in. FIN (7/7)
